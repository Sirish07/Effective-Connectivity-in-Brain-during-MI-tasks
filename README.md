## Aim ##

The aim of the project is to study Effective Connectivity in Brain during motor imagery tasks and compare it with neuroscientific literature. Normalised Transfer Entropy and Partial Directed Coherence are used to generate information flow graphs. The graphs are evaluated by Transfer Entropy and Granger Causality using Graph Similarity Metrics.

### Requirements ###
* networkx
* pyitlib
* IDTxl
* coonectivipy
* scipy

### Pipeline ###
The raw data needs to be preprocessed to eliminate bias and obtain data within frequency of interest. 
`y = preprocess(filepath,index)` returns preprocessed data with filepath and subject index as ID.`A1 = NTE(filepath,index)` returns adjacency matrix generated by normalised transfer entropy.`A2 = PDC(filepath,index)` returns adjacency matrix generated by Partial Directed Coherence. Similarly, Adjancency Matrices are generated by running Transfer Entropy and Granger Causality scripts.`G = GED(A1,A2)` returns graph edit distances betweeen the adjancency matrices.
